	<div class="title">Trophy Club Emergency Volunteer Association</div>
		<p>The Trophy Club Emergency Volunteer Association (TCEVA) serves
			under the umbrellas of both the Trophy Club Police and Fire
			Departments. It is a 501(c)(3) organization that utilizes its funds
			to support Trophy Clubâ€™s first responders through the purchase of
			equipment, supplies, and trainings, as well as participation in
			various programs. Some of these programs include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Traffic control</li>
			<li>Citizen on Patrol (COP) Volunteers enhance the safety of our
				community by patrolling in a specially marked vehicle and alerting
				the Police of any suspicious activity. This position requires
				training.</li>
			<li>Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT)</li>
			<li>First Responder Rehab (REHAB)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Our volunteers either live or work in Trophy Club and come from
			various professional and personal backgrounds. Many of us have
			additional training and certifications, which allow us to volunteer
			in several different programs while assisting the town with
			emergencies and public events.</p>
		<p>Membership is contingent upon passing a background check. All
			members are expected to follow the Volunteer Code of Conduct as
			defined in the TCEVA policies, and membership will continue at the
			discretion of the Trophy Club Police chief and Fire Chief.</p>
		<p>
			A membership application is available <a

		<p>Our mission statement:</p>
		<p>To support and assist the Trophy Club Police Department and
			Fire Department, promote public awareness and education by serving as
			ambassadors of the Trophy Club Police Department and Fire Department
			to the public and to other agencies, and promote a safe environment
			for First Responders and Residents through service and activities.</p>
